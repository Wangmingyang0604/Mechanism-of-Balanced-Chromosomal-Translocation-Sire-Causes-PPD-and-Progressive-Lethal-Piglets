##Deciphering the mechanism of a t(9;18)(p21;q24) balanced translocation leads to preaxial polydactyly and progressive lethal piglets

  Code of analysis during study of “Deciphering the mechanism of a t(9;18)(p21;q24) balanced translocation leads to preaxial polydactyly and progressive lethal piglets”
##Introduction
  An integrative multi-omics framework is used to systematically explore the genetic mechanisms underlying balanced translocations and their unbalanced inheritance associated with polydactyly and progressive lethality.
